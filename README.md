## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The User for this app would be anyone interested in books who wants to keep a wishlist and keep track of what books they've bought.


## Features <!-- List your app features using bullets! Do NOT use a paragraph. No one will read that! -->
- Full CRUD for both the author's and the books
- Author books relationship, authors can be viewed in book details and books in author details, deleting an author deletes all thier books. New books can only choose from available authors
- User specificity, you can only see books and authors you have added
- Profile page that display user info
